# Take-Home Back End Prompt
## Tea Subscription Service
You will create a Rails API for a Tea Subscription Service.

## Requirements:
At a minimum, you must create:

1. An endpoint to subscribe a customer to a tea subscription
2. An endpoint to cancel a customer’s tea subscription
3. An endpoint to see all of a customer’s subsciptions (active and cancelled)

Beyond the base requirements, include any additional endpoints you’d like, but be mindful of your time. You don’t need to go overboard, consider what might be necessary to achieve MVP so that this API is easy to understand and consume by a Frontend Developer.

## Things we’ll be looking for:
- A strong understanding of Rails
- Ability to create restful routes
- Demonstration of well-organized code, following OOP
- Test Driven Development
- Clear documentation
- Try to limit your total time to approximately 8 hours on this project. Prioritize what is important to completing MVP and demonstrating your capabilities as a developer. If you are looking for a stretch option, you can consume this API for tea product information: Spoontacular API
